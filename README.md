# cloudForAll
I was a CSST(Cross-disciplinary Scholars in Sci & Tech) program student working at Design Automation Laboratory. My advisor is Prof. Lei He. I was working on the project Shading Prediction for Solar Farm. The project finished following parts

-Proposed a solution for shading effects on a solar farm to mitigate large power loss

-Distinguished cloud and sky using supervised learning, resulting in 99.4% accuracy

-Improved cloud tracking algorithm by adding noise cancellation and introducing simulated annealing to HEXBS, resulting in 23.0X speed up

-Verified robustness of the algorithm using sensitivity analysis
